## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

   https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

   My browser was having trouble with the sound playback. At first I examined the code in cpomparison to the tutorial. I asked myself: "What lines of code would have altered sound playback?, Is it my sound or the IDE?
   ". After analyzing the code I caught no errors from following the tutorial so then it was more about hardware error. I cheked my browsers sound, I turned off third party streaming applicatons,
   and I turned off my PCs cast and bluetooth. After that did not work either I restarted the IDE, browser, than PC, after that did not work, I restarted. Finally after what was
   probably half an hour I decided to just stop and take a break. For some reason that worked and after that I was able to countinue building. I realize now that sometimes errors or
   even hardware problems just need a second, by stepping a way I gave myself and my PC time to figure ourselves out readjust and comeback with a different mindset.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

What is the best way to learn web development?
How do web developers know when a certain marking is appropriate?
How do web developers know that the format of the page is appropriate for use?
How does finance play into web development? I ask this question because you have to pay for domains and IDES, which makes me kind of understand why I see so many people using third-party applications to make and host their websites.
How do I implement a Java game into a webpage or would I have to translate it to JavaScript?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

If I had a few more hours, I would definitely change the sounds to something more unique. Additionally, I would change the format of the website to make it more aesthetically pleasing and trendy. Lastly, I would probably add a scoreboard. The last game I helped build showcased an old fashion arcade scoreboard, I remember that making the game all more, enticing to the player.
